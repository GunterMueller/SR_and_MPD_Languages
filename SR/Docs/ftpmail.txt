NAME
     ftpmail - FTP access via electronic mail

SYNOPSIS
     mail ftpmail@cs.arizona.edu

DESCRIPTION
     ftpmail gives any person with email connectivity  access  to
     the   University  of  Arizona  Computer  Science  Department
     anonymous ftp site.  ftpmail takes a script contained in the
     body  of  an email message and follows it to obtain listings
     and transfer files from a remote network site.  The  subject
     line  of  the message is ignored.  Large files will be split
     into manageable chunks, each of which will be mailed to  the
     user.   Binary  files  will  be made suitable for email with
     either uuencode or btoa.

COMMANDS
     Valid commands to the ftpmail server are:

     reply-to email-address
          Who to send the response to.  Defaults to your incoming
          email address.

     help
          Send  this  help  file.   All  other  instructions  are
          ignored.

     open [ site [ user [ pass ] ] ]
          The open command is mandatory.  Only cs.arizona.edu can
          be  accessed from this server, but it must be specified
          as the site to log in as any user other than anonymous.
          User  and  password  can  be  specified  for users with
          accounts    on    cs.arizona.edu.      Defaults     are
          cs.arizona.edu, anonymous, reply-to address.

     cd pathname
          change directory

     ls [ pathname ]
          get short listing  of  pathname  (defaults  to  current
          directory).

     ls -lR [ pathname ]
          long recursive listing of pathname (defaults to current
          directory).

     dir [ pathname ]
          long listing of pathname (defaults  to  current  direc-
          tory).

     get pathname
          get a file and email back to user.

     compress
          compress files and directory listings using compress(1)
          before emailing back to user.

     btoa | uuencode
          These are mutually exclusive options for  converting  a
          binary file before emailing. Default is uuencode(1).

     force btoa | uuencode
          Force all files or directory  listings  to  be  encoded
          before sending back.  There is no default.

     mode ascii | binary
          Set the mode selected for the get command for line ter-
          mination.  Defaults to binary.

     quit
          End of input - ignore any following lines.

EXAMPLES
     Connect to cs.arizona.edu and send back a  long  listing  of
     the top level of the ftp directory.
          open
          dir
          quit



     Connect to cs.arizona.edu and send back the files tachie.lab
     and  nikkei.ai  from  the japan/kahaner.reports directory to
     lmjm@doc.ic.ac.uk

          reply-to lmjm@doc.ic.ac.uk
          open
          cd japan/kahaner.reports
          get tachie.lab
          get nikkei.ai
          quit



     Connect to cs.arizona.edu, send back the  file  TR92-09.ps.Z
     in  the reports/1992 directory.  As this is a binary file it
     has to be transferred in binary mode.  Because it is  binary
     it  will  automatically  be  uuencoded  (the  default binary
     encoder).    Then   change  to  ../../sr  and  mail  back  a
     compressed  directory listing.  Although compressing ls out-
     put makes it binary, which then has to be encoded, it  still
     ends up smaller than the original.

          open
          cd reports/1992
          get TR92-09.ps.Z
          cd ../../sr
          compress
          ls -ltra
          quit

     perl) and ftp, and probably others.
