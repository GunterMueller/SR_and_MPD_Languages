#  srgrind tests
#
#  "tricky.sr" is designed to challenge srgrind.  Unfortunately, the best tests
#  can't be automated.  What's needed is to typeset the output of each of the
#  sgrind runs below, checking the results manually.
#
#  What we can do here is check that the test program compiles and runs, and
#  that srgrind can at least handle options and produce an output file without
#  bombing.
