The file in here are test files and answer files:
    xxx.in	test file
    xxx.std	expected output from scan  (tests scanf)
    xxx.sstd	expected output from sscan (tests sscanf)

The format for a test file is:
 1)  # at the beginning of line terminates test
 2)  $a <number>  sets the argtype
         argtypes:
		1  ii
		2  s
		3  ss
		4  cs
		5  b
		6  bb
		7  i j ca[i:j]
		8  rr
		9  p
		10 rs
 3)  $f<string>  sets the format string passed to [s]scanf.  A space
	between the 'f' and <string> results in a space in the format.
	So $f %i%i yields format string of ' %i%i'.
 4)  $d<line>  is a data line.  Scan begins with char following the 'd'.


In this dir the tst.* test files ' should run with no errors.
Those beginning with 'arg' are error due to invalid args or such.
etc.
