This directory holds modified versions of the examples from the SR book.
The changes allow incorporation of the programs into the verification suite.
Examples of the kinds of modifications are:
    embedding fragments in complete programs
    reducing output precision to hide floating-point hardware differences
    removing irreproducible outputs such as age() values
    changes to remove program nondeterminism
	or to allow it to be hidden by sorting the output
