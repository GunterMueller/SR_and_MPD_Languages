The chap* directories contain copies of the SR programs and fragments
appearing in "The SR Programming Language: Concurrency in Practice",
by Gregory R. Andrews and Ronald A. Olsson (Benjamin/Cummings, 1993,
ISBN 0-8053-0088-0).  Not all of the files form complete programs;
examples of complete programs can be found in the full verification
suite under vsuite/book.

Sample programs for the SR preprocessors are in csp2sr, m2sr, and ccr2sr.
Some miscellaneous other SR programs are in the "other" subdirectory.

Besides the source files there are Script files, data files, and *.std files.
These are used by the "srv" program to validate the SR system.
