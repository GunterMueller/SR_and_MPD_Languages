#  The following SR program found an apparent bug in the Sun C
#  preprocessor; works fine on Vax.  We've isolated the bug as shown
#  below.  It is very sensitive to the location of newlines, but this is
#  like the code that sr generates.

resource main()
    op str() returns str :string[10]
    proc str() returns str  str := ""  end
    initial write("'"||str()) end
end
