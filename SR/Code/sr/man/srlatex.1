.SH NAME
srlatex \- format SR program for LaTeX
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBsrlatex [ \-ep ] [ \-l \fRlang\fP ]
[ \-a \fIn\fP ] [ \-t \fIn\fP ] [ \fRfile ... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.I Srlatex
formats an SR program for use with
.IR latex(1).
To include an SR program formatted with
.I srlatex,
use document-style option
.IR srlatex
and include the file with the output generated by
.I srlatex
with an
.IR \einput{
.I filename
.IR }
command.
The document style option defines various parameters concerning the
typesetting aspects.
For example, fonts for keywords, identifiers, literal
strings, and comments are defined there.
Input is read from the
named files, or from standard input if none are given.
Output is written to standard output.
.LP
.I Srlatex
tries hard to keep indentation and alignment the same as the original program.
Horizontal positioning is recalculated (to preserve vertical columns)
after reading a tab character or three consecutive spaces.
The average character width used to calculate columns is fixed (as defined by
.I \esrTeXcw
in the style file).
If text exceeds this average length, a warning
is printed and the text is typeset in its natural width.
.LP
The following options are accepted:
.TP
.BI \-e
Enable escape sequence.
Text between the delimiters \fI#<\fR and
\fI>#\fR is passed to the typesetting program directly.
The delimiters themselves are not printed.
This allows to include arbitrary LaTeX commands in a program.
Note that the SR compiler regards the whole line as a comment.
.TP
.BI \-l\ \fIlang\fR
Select one of the following source languages:
.nf
.ta .5i
\fBsr\fP	SR (Synchronizing Resources)
\fBftsr\fP	Fault-Tolerant SR
\fBpl\fP	Programming Logic (from \fIConcurrent Programming\fP)
.fi
.in +.5i
PL adds the keywords
.BR await ,
.BR barrier ,
.BR chan ,
.BR cond ,
.BR empty ,
.BR minrank ,
.BR monitor ,
.BR region ,
.BR signal ,
.BR signal_all ,
.BR wait ,
and
.B when
to SR.
.TP
.BI \-p
Produce a wrapper allowing output to be fed directly into LaTeX.
By default,
.I srlatex
produces output to be included in a larger document.
.TP
.BI \-t " n"
Set tab stops every
.I n
columns.
The default is every eight columns.
.TP
.BI \-a " n"
Set the number of spaces that force column alignment.
The default is three.
A large value inhibits alignment and usually looks ugly.
