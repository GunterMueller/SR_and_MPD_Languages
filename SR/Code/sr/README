SR is described in "The SR Programming Language: Concurrency in Practice"
by Gregory R. Andrews and Ronald A. Olsson (Benjamin/Cummings, 1993, ISBN
0-8053-0088-0).  Information about concurrent programming in general can be
found in "Concurrent Programming: Principles and Practice" by Gregory R.

The ./ps directory contains documentation in PostScript form, including:
	language.ps	an overview of the SR language
	release.ps	release notes, including problems and limitations
	install.ps	installation instructions
	manpages.ps	typeset versions of the manual pages
	srwin.ps	a report describing the SRWin X-windows interface
	sranimator.ps	a report describing the XTANGO animation interface
Troff source for many of these files is in the ./doc directory.
README files in both of those directories give further details.

See ./Systems for a list of targeted architectures and special platform-
dependent installation requirements.

The SR system is in the public domain and you may use and distribute it
as you wish.  We ask that you retain credits referencing the University
of Arizona and that you identify any changes you make.

We can't provide a warranty with SR; it's up to you to determine its
suitability and reliability for your needs.  We do intend to maintain
SR as resources permit, and would like to hear of any problems.
