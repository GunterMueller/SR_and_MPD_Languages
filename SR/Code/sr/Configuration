##  Configuration file for SR.
#
#   Make changes here to customize SR for your environment.



##  Current version number and date.
#   These are embedded in sr and srl, and in the C code they produce.

VERSION = "SR version 2.3.3"



##  Basic configuration parameters.
#   Be sure that each directory is an absolute path (beginning with "/").
#
#   SRCMD, SRLIB, and MAN1/3/5 can all be the same directory if you wish.
#
#	SRSRC:	SR source hierarchy (the directory containing this Makefile)
#	SRCMD:	directory in which to install sr(1), srl(1), etc.
#	SRLIB:	directory in which to install srlib.a and other "hidden" files
#	MAN1:	directory in which to install the man(1) pages
#	MANEXT:	1 or l (one or ell) or 1n extension as appropriate to that dir
#	MAN3:	directory in which to install man pages of library routines
#		(extension will be `tr 1 3` of MANEXT)
#	MAN5:	directory in which to install the srmap/srtrace(5) man pages
#		(extension will be `tr 1 5` of MANEXT)

SRSRC = /usr/local/src/sr
SRCMD = /usr/local/bin
SRLIB = /usr/local/lib/sr
MAN1 = /usr/man/manl
MAN3 = /usr/man/manl
MAN5 = /usr/man/manl
MANEXT = l



##  Absolute paths for programs and files referenced within SR components.
#   These usually require no change, but they're parameterized here in case
#   the given values are inappropriate.  These definitions do not affect the
#   commands issued to *build* SR.
#
#   An alternate C compiler can also be selected here, if it accepts
#   the same parameters as cc(1).  If you do this, you should also
#   change the CC definition in the Makefile so that the SR system
#   (especially the runtime library) is built by the same compiler.
#
#   for System V Unixes (e.g. HP-UX, DG-UX) use:  RSHPATH = /usr/bin/remsh
#   but for Sun Solaris 2.x use:		  RSHPATH = /bin/rsh
#   for Linux, NetBSD, or FreeBSD use:		  RSHPATH = /usr/bin/rsh
#   for Irix use:				  RSHPATH = /usr/bsd/rsh
#
#   for Sun Solaris with Sun's C compiler use:	  CCPATH = /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc
#   for Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, or SGI Irix use:  CCPATH = /usr/bin/cc

CCPATH = /bin/cc
RSHPATH = /usr/ucb/rsh



##  Additional C libraries needed beyond the default
#
#   LIBC is linked with everything
#   LIBM is linked when the math library is needed
#   LIBR is linked with user SR programs
#
#   for Sequent, assuming ucb universe: LIBC = -lseq
#					LIBM = -lm /usr/att/lib/libm.a
#	and if configuring for MultiSR:	LIBR = -lpps
#	(also need CFLAGS=-Y in main Makefile in that case)
#
#   for Sun Solaris 2.x, set LIBC = -lsocket -lnsl;
#   for Solaris MultiSR configuration, also set LIBR = -lthread
#
#   for Linux, set LIBR = -L/usr/X11/lib, LIBM = -lm -lc
#
#   for Intel Paragon, set LIBC = -lnx
#
#   In all other cases, leave the original values alone:
#   LIBC = ,  LIBR = ,  LIBM = -lm

LIBC = 
LIBR =  -L/usr/X11/lib
LIBM = -lm



##  Include directories needed by library routines.
#
#   XINCL is the directory containing the X11 include directory.
#   If not set, SRWin is not built.
#
#   XTANGO is the directory containing xtango.h.
#   If not set, SRanimator is not built.
#
#   for Sun Solaris 2.x, set XINCL = /usr/openwin/include
#   for NetBSD, set XINCL = /usr/X386/include
#   for Linux, set XINCL = /usr/X11/include

XINCL = /usr/include
XTANGO = 



##  The vgrind(1) back end, and its macro package; used by srgrind.
#
#   Set these definitions empty if your system does not have vgrind.

VFPATH = /usr/lib/vfontedpr
VGMACS = 



##  VMASK specifies a standard umask(2) for srv and srvi to always use.

VMASK = 0002
