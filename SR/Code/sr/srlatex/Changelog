	* minor changes for portability and SR coding style

Mon Nov 30 10:16:23 1992  David Mosberger  (davidm@antigua)

	* scan.l: keyword "recovery" added for FT-SR

Sun Nov 29 21:08:12 1992  David Mosberger  (davidm@antigua)

	* scan.l, print.c: added support for FT-SR

	* srlatex.h: created, contains global definitions

	* print.c: changed colon() such that it is printed in text mode
	and surrounded by \, space (it's generated as "\,:\," now...)

Mon Oct 19 11:23:58 1992  David Mosberger  (davidm@antigua)

	* srlatex.sty: merged OFSS and NFSS versions; now there is only
	one style file for both font selection schemes

	* srlatex.sty: added \leavevmode to \srTeXmb command

	* Makefile: added install target and a couple of macros to
	configure the installation process

Sun Oct 18 23:07:44 1992  David Mosberger  (davidm@antigua)

	* srlatex.sty: if text doesn't fit into computed width, issue
	warning *plus input line number* (not just warning)

Tue Feb  4 14:39:26 1992  David Mosberger  (davidm at cheltenham)

	* print.c: default values for option latex and SR are now
	determined by program name; if first two letters are ``sr'' option
	SR is set, if the second and third letter are ``la'' option latex
	is set.

	* option ``-s'' controls if plain SR or the programming logic PL
	is to be typeset (PL has more keywords, for example)

Mon Feb  3 10:53:37 1992  David Mosberger  (davidm at cheltenham)

	* print.c: option `-f' introduced, if set, causes page break after
	program text (this was the default behavior before

	* print.c: all boolean options are now toggles; latex is now true
	by default

Sun Feb  2 15:17:34 1992  David Mosberger  (davidm at cheltenham)

	* print.c, scan.l: added await as keyword (not really an SR
	keyword but useful for homeworks...)

	* print.c, scan.l: added support for literal (La-)TeX text; text
	enclosed between #< and ># is passed literally (nesting is
	supported...)
