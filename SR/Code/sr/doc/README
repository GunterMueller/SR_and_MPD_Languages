This directory contains troff(1) source for those PostScript files in ../ps
which are formatted using troff.  The README in ../ps lists the documents and
their contents.

The Makefiles here and in ../man build the PostScript files.  Because troff
variants abound, they should just be considered guides;  you'll probably have
to experiment to make things work.  There are some non-critical references to
local files such as tech report covers that will need to be removed.

Some informal notes, not all current or correct, are stored as simple
text files in ../notes.
