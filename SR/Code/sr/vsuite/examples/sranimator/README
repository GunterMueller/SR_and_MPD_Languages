This directory contains several programs illustrating the use of SRanimator.
(Note that SRanimator requires XTANGO, which must first be built separately.)

A Makefile is provided; you'll need to set the TLIB variable to point to the
location of xtango.o on your system.  Running "make" with no arguments builds
the non-trivial animations.  Remember to run "xrdb -merge XTANGO/xtango.res"
before running the animations.

The files included here are:

bubblesort.sr
quicksort.sr
	Two animations of sorting algorithms.

dining.sr
	Distributed dining philosophers, based on section 13.3 of the SR book.

bbdriver.sr
bbproc.sr
bbin.sr
	The bounded buffer problem.  bbin uses rendezvous; bbproc uses calls.

rwdriver.sr
rwfair.sr
rwstarve.sr
	Two readers-writers animations.  rwstarve starves the writers;
	rwfair is more fair.

hello.sr
tfonts.sr
tlines.sr
tresize.sr
tsteps.sr
tzoom.sr
	Simple tests, not built by default.
