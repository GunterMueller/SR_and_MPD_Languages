Systems Supporting SR
Version 2.3.3

January 18, 2005
Gregg Townsend


This version of SR was built and tested on these platforms:

    Intel x86 (Linux)
    Sun Sparc (Solaris)

Code is also included for these systems:

    Apollo DN (Domain/OS SR10.3)
    Data General AViiON (DG/UX)
    DEC VAX (Ultrix or BSD Unix)
    DEC MIPS (Ultrix)
    DEC Alpha (Digital Unix, Linux)
    Encore Multimax (Umax)
    Harris HC/UX (Tahoe architecture)
    HP PA-RISC (HP-UX)
    HP 9000 series 300 (HP-UX)
    IBM RS/6000 (AIX)
    Intel 386/486/Pentium (SVR4, NetBSD, FreeBSD)
    Intel Paragon (OSF/1)
    Motorola System V/68
    NeXT (Mach)
    Sequent Symmetry (Dynix 3.2 under "ucb" universe; NOT Dynix/PTX)
    Silicon Graphics (Irix)
    Sun 3 (SunOS 4)
    Sun 4 / Sparc (SunOS 4)

Additionally, any other system running Unix System V Release 4 is a candidate
using csw/svr4.c for context switching; see the "Untested Systems" section
below.

SR is written in C with a little assembly code for context switching.
Bison can substitute for Yacc and Flex can substitute for Lex.

The notes below give additional information for particular systems.  In many
cases, certain tests in the full verification suite (vsuite) are known to fail
because of C compiler bugs or other system limitations.  These are isolated
problems that do not affect the majority of SR programs.  In addition,
misc/srgrind fails on all systems lacking the Berkeley "vgrind" program.


******************************  Tested Systems  ******************************


Intel x86 architecture running Linux:

    Tested on: Red Hat Linux 9 (Kernel 2.4) and Fedora 2 (Kernel 2.6).

    Before building, set "LIBM= -lm -lc" and "LIBR=-L/usr/X11/lib"
    in ./Configuration.

    Multi-SR is unreliable in recent versions of Intel Linux.
    (This is only a problem if you configure Multi-SR and run
    with SR_PARALLEL set in the environment.)


Sun SPARC architecture running Solaris:

    Tested on: SunOS 5.7 and 5.9 using cc
    (the unbundled SunPro compiler, "C 5.0")

    Before building, set "LIBC=-lsocket -lnsl" and "RSHPATH=/bin/rsh" in
    ./Configuration, and set CCPATH as appropriate.  If using SunPro C,
    also set "CFLAGS=-D__svr4__ -g" in the main Makefile.

    IMPORTANT: SR for Solaris does not need the BSD compatibility package.
    Be sure that /usr/ucb is NOT in the search path when running "make".

    A small number of warning messages are produced during the build.

    Vsuite failures:  These tests fail due to incorrect assumptions
    about the system time() function:
	builtin/nap, misc/external, misc/extref

    Under Solaris, use of MultiSR precludes use of virtual machines.
    When MultiSR configured *and enabled* (by setting SR_PARALLEL > 1)
    the following additional vsuite tests fail:
	book/chap12/main2, book/chap15/vm, create/chairs, diag/runtime
	diag/trace, examples/other/mbrot, examples/other/remote, global/[3456],
	in/cap/remote, literal/cap, misc/timeslice2, quick/vm, vm/*


******************************  Untested Systems  ******************************


DEC Alpha (Tru64 Unix, aka OSF/1, aka Digital Unix):

    Tested on: Digital Unix version 4.0 / 564.

    This implementation provides 32 bit integers for SR's int type although
    these machines support 64 bit ints.  Thus, SR's int corresponds to C's int.


Dec Alpha (Linux):

    Tested on: Red Hat Linux 6.0 (Kernel 2.2.5).

    Before building, set "LIBM= -lm -lc" and "LIBR=-L/usr/X11/lib"
    in ./Configuration.

    Numerous warning messages are produced while building SR,
    but the system seems to run correctly.

    Vsuite failure:  misc/external fails because it assumes that the
    system time_t datatype is the same size as an int.


Silicon Graphics:

    Tested on:	Indigo2 (MIPS R10000 chip) running Irix 6.5.

    This system is configured for the O32 (Irix 5) or N32 (Irix 6.2) ABI.
    It does not work with the N64 (Irix 6.0) ABI.

    Before building, set CCPATH=/usr/bin/cc and RSHPATH=/usr/bsd/rsh
    in ./Configuration.  Also add "-w" to the CFLAGS in the Makefile
    if you don't want a huge volume of helpful warnings about (mostly)
    legal C code.

    Note: The assembly code in ./csw must be built using /bin/as,
    not the GNU assembler.


IBM RS/6000:

    Tested on: IBM RS/6000 model 43P (PowerPC 604 chip) running AIX 4.3.

    Vsuite failure: quick/jumble fails its optimization test (sr -O).
    The test program runs correctly without optimization.


System V Release 4:

    To build SR on a generic SVR4 system, edit csw/Makefile to use the
    SVR4 library functions makecontext/setcontext fo context switching.
    Remove the four lines specifying the build of "asm.o" and replace
    them with these two lines:

	    asm.o:  svr4.c
		    $(CC) $(CFLAGS) -c -o asm.o svr4.c

    We once tested this on a Sun running Solaris, but on that platform
    the sparc.s context switching code is used by choice because it is
    considerably faster.


Apollo:

    We have included code from an Apollo port of SR Version 1 that was done
    using GCC and GAS.  This was tested under Domain/OS version 10.3.
    Gcc was used instead of cc because cc defines __STDC__ when it isn't
    really a standard C compiler.  The generated code is compiled by cc.

    Change the main Makefile to specify
	CC = gcc
	AS = gas
	CFLAGS = -Dap3000

    The assembly language code was slightly modified for SR V2 and has
    not been tested.


Data General AViiON:

    Be sure to set RSHPATH=/usr/bin/remsh in ./Configuration.
    SR V1 was never completely verified on the AViiON, and V2 is untried.


DEC VAX:

    SR Version 1 ran on the Vax.  We no longer have a Vax available for
    testing Version 2.  Under Vax Ultrix, SR worked with gcc or cc,
    but not with vcc.


DEC MIPS:

    Earlier versions were tested on a Decstation 3100 running Ultrix V4.3
    Rev 43, using "cc", and on a DEC 5000 running Ultrix V4.2A.

    Vsuite failures: with standard cc, the misc/swap vsuite test provokes
    a Trace/BPT trap in the compiler, and misc/rmember also fails.

    An earlier version of SR was tested using c89 ("Dec C for Ultrix on RISC
    V1.0").  With this compiler, sr/input.c got a bugcheck when built with -g;
    the fix is to build without -g.  Srwin did not build with c89.  The vsuite
    tests misc/exprs, misc/swap, and rec/3 failed due to compiler bugs; we have
    been told that at least some of these are fixed in c89 V1.1.  Some other
    failures appeared to be similar but were investigated in detail.


Encore Multimax:

    SR V2 (single threaded) has been build on Umax 4.13 using some special
    procedures.  cc was used for the csw directory; gcc was used for all
    other directories.  Because the grammar is too complex for the Encore
    version of Yacc, the .c and .h files were generated on another system.


Harris HC/UX (Tahoe architecture):

    Contributed code from SR Version 1 is included.  Version 2 is untested.


HP PA-RISC (9000/800, 9000/700 series):

    Version 2.3.1 was tested on: Hewlett-Packard 9000/735 running HP-UX 9.01.

    Before building, change RSHPATH as indicated in ./Configuration.

    Ignore any messages about "ranlib: ar already did it for you".

    Vsuite failure: misc/rmember fails due to a compiler bug.

    Note: won't build with the gnu assembler (as).


HP 9000/300 series:

    Version 2.1 was tested on: Hewlett-Packard 9000/330 running HP-UX 7.0.

    Before building, change RSHPATH as indicated in ./Configuration.
    Also set CFLAGS = +Np300 +Nw500 in the main Makefile.

    Ignore any messages about "ranlib: ar already did it for you".

    Vsuite failures:
    
	array/slice/2 fails due to a C preprocessor bug.

	quick/jumble takes an especially long time to compile on this
	system when optimization is enabled.


Intel 386/486/Pentium (SVR4):

    We have included contributed code for an SVR4 system but we cannot
    test this configuration.


Intel 386/486/Pentium (NetBSD):

    Earlier version tested on: i386-netbsd 0.9a

    Before building, set "XINCL=/usr/X386/include" in ./Configuration.

    SR was built for testing using GNU Make (gmake).  The standard "make"
    has problems with the library references ($$LIBx) in several Makefiles.


Intel 386/486/Pentium (FreeBSD):

    Earlier version tested on: FreeBSD-2.0.950412-SNAP and 
    FreeBSD-2.1-Development.

    Before building, set "XINCL=/usr/X11R6/include" in ./Configuration.

    SR was built for testing using GNU Make (gmake).


Intel Paragon:

    Earlier version tested on: 16-node Intel Paragon XP/S model A4
    (16 MB per node) running OSF/1 release 1.2.1.

    A partition name must be specified to run an SR program.  The easiest
    way to do this is to set the environment variable NX_DFLT_PART.  See
    the release notes for more information about how the SR programming
    model is mapped onto the Paragon architecture.

    It is possible in principle to generate an SR cross-compiler on a
    machine supporting the Paragon cross development tools, but this
    configuration is not supported by SR.  SR must be built and run on
    the Paragon itself.

    Before building, set LIBR=-lnx in ./Configuration.

    IMPORTANT:  The Paragon "make" utility doesn't handle the "#" character
    properly.  The workaround is to always use "pmake MAKE=pmake" in place
    of "make".

    The Paragon's C preprocessor folds very long lines (over 400 characters)
    generated by macro expansion.  This causes csp2sr, and presumably the
    other SR preprocessors as well, to produce illegal SR code under rare
    circumstances.

    It appears that CLOCKS_PER_SEC is defined incorrectly in <time.h>.
    This has no effect on SR programs but cause the csw/csloop timing
    program (not normally run) to give incorrect results.

    Vsuite failure: examples/csp2sr/sort2, due to the line folding problem.


Sequent Symmetry:

    Version 2.3 was tested on: Sequent Symmetry running Dynix 3.2.

    Before building, edit ./Configuration and set LIBC and LIBM for the Sequent
    as indicated in the comments there.  Also edit the main Makefile and add
    CFLAGS=-Y if you are building MultiSR; see the installation documentation
    for details.

    This port was done under the "ucb" universe of Dynix.  Installation under
    Dynix/PTX has not been tried and is not likely to succeed without much pain.

    MultiSR does not build with the ATS C compiler (atscc): the necessary -Y
    compiler option evokes numerous bogus "function redefined" diagnostics.
    Single-threaded SR builds and runs correctly using atscc (without -Y).

    The SRWin X-windows interface does not work very well, for reasons that
    are not understood; and it does not work at all under MultiSR.

    Vsuite failure: the misc/rmember vsuite test fails.



Sun 4 / Sparc running SunOS version 4 (sometimes called Solaris 1.1):

    Version 2.3.1 was tested on: Sun 4/490 running SunOS 4.1.1, using "cc".

    Vsuite failure: with standard (bundled) cc, the misc/rmember test fails.

    Sun's "acc" compiler gives a segmentation fault on some architectures
    when compiling rts/io.c and rts/scan.c with -g; the fix is to compile
    without -g.  (The "acc" configuration has not been tested recently.)


Sun 3:

    Version 2.3 was tested on: Sun 3/80 running SunOS 4.1.1.

    Vsuite failure: with standard (bundled) cc, the misc/rmember test fails.


Motorola System V/68:

    Contributed code from SR Version 1 is included.  Version 2 is untested.


NeXT:

    Version 2.1 was tested on: NeXT Mach 2.1

    Vsuite failures: several tests fail because the NeXT outputs floating
    point numbers incorrectly.  The tests are:

	array/rec/slice, book/chap01/matrix, book/chap04/trapezoidal,
	book/chap07/mult, book/chap09/quadrature, book/chap14/*,
	builtin/general, create/args1, global/1, global/2, global/op,
	invoke/ref, io/read, misc/exprs, misc/fa, misc/getarg,
	misc/swap, quick/jumble, real/array, real/external
