##  Configuration file for MPD.
#
#   Make changes here to customize MPD for your environment.



##  Current version number and date.
#   These are embedded in mpd and mpdl, and in the C code they produce.

VERSION = "MPD version 1.0.1, January 2004"



##  Basic configuration parameters.
#   Be sure that each directory is an absolute path (beginning with "/").
#
#   MPDCMD, MPDLIB, and MAN1/3/5 can all be the same directory if you wish.
#
#	MPDSRC:	MPD source hierarchy (the directory containing this Makefile)
#	MPDCMD:	directory in which to install mpd(1), mpdl(1), etc.
#	MPDLIB:	directory in which to install mpdlib.a and other "hidden" files
#	MAN1:	directory in which to install the man(1) pages
#	MANEXT:	1 or l (one or ell) or 1n extension as appropriate to that dir
#	MAN3:	directory in which to install man pages of library routines
#		(extension will be `tr 1 3` of MANEXT)
#	MAN5:	directory in which to install the mpdmap/mpdtrace(5) man pages
#		(extension will be `tr 1 5` of MANEXT)

MPDSRC = /usr/local/src/mpd
MPDCMD = /usr/local/bin
MPDLIB = /usr/local/lib/mpd
MAN1 = /usr/local/man/man1
MAN3 = /usr/local/man/man3
MAN5 = /usr/local/man/man5
MANEXT = 1



##  Absolute paths for programs and files referenced within MPD components.
#   These usually require no change, but they're parameterized here in case
#   the given values are inappropriate.  These definitions do not affect the
#   commands issued to *build* MPD.
#
#   An alternate C compiler can also be selected here, if it accepts
#   the same parameters as cc(1).  If you do this, you should also
#   change the CC definition in the Makefile so that the MPD system
#   (especially the runtime library) is built by the same compiler.
#
#   for System V Unixes (e.g. HP-UX, DG-UX) use:  RSHPATH = /usr/bin/remsh
#   but for Sun Solaris use:			  RSHPATH = /bin/rsh
#   for Linux, NetBSD, or FreeBSD use:		  RSHPATH = /usr/bin/rsh
#   for Irix use:				  RSHPATH = /usr/bsd/rsh
#
#   for Sun Solaris with Sun's C compiler use:	  CCPATH = /opt/SUNWspro/bin/cc
#   for Linux, NetBSD, FreeBSD, or SGI Irix use:  CCPATH = /usr/bin/cc

CCPATH = /bin/cc
RSHPATH = /usr/bin/rsh



##  Additional C libraries needed beyond the default
#
#   LIBC is linked with everything
#   LIBM is linked when the math library is needed
#   LIBR is linked with user MPD programs
#
#   for Sun Solaris, set LIBC = -lsocket -lnsl;
#   for Solaris MultiMPD configuration, also set LIBR = -lthread
#
#   for Linux, set LIBR = -L/usr/X11R6/lib, LIBM = -lm -lc
#
#   In all other cases, leave the original values alone:
#   LIBC = ,  LIBR = ,  LIBM = -lm

LIBC = 
LIBR =  -L/usr/X11R6/lib
LIBM = -lm



##  Include directories needed by library routines.
#
#   XINCL is the directory containing the X11 include directory.
#   If not set, MPDWin is not built.
#
#   XTANGO is the directory containing xtango.h.
#   If not set, MPDanimator is not built.
#
#   for Sun Solaris 2.x, set XINCL = /usr/openwin/include
#   for NetBSD, set XINCL = /usr/X386/include
#   for Linux, set XINCL = /usr/X11R6/include

XINCL = /usr/X11R6/include
XTANGO = 



##  VMASK specifies a standard umask(2) for mpdv and mpdvi to always use.

VMASK = 0002
