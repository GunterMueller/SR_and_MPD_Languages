MPD vsuite/examples/animator README

This directory contains several programs illustrating the use of MPDanimator.
(Note that MPDanimator requires XTANGO, which must first be built separately.)

A Makefile is provided; you'll need to set the TLIB variable to point to the
location of xtango.o on your system.  Running "make" with no arguments builds
the non-trivial animations.  Remember to run "xrdb -merge XTANGO/xtango.res"
before running the animations.

The files included here are:

bubblesort.mpd
quicksort.mpd
	Two animations of sorting algorithms.

dining.mpd
	Distributed dining philosophers, based on section 13.3 of the SR book.

bbdriver.mpd
bbproc.mpd
bbin.mpd
	The bounded buffer problem.  bbin uses rendezvous; bbproc uses calls.

rwdriver.mpd
rwfair.mpd
rwstarve.mpd
	Two readers-writers animations.  rwstarve starves the writers;
	rwfair is more fair.

hello.mpd
tfonts.mpd
tlines.mpd
tresize.mpd
tsteps.mpd
tzoom.mpd
	Simple tests, not built by default.
