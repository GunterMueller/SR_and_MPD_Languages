MPD vsuite/examples README

This directory contains some examples of complete MPD programs.  Many
of these have been converted (with little polishing) from SR programs.
The files are grouped into subdirectories:

    tutorial	Programs from the MPD tutorial,
    		http://www.cs.arizona.edu/mpd/programs/tutorial.html

    chap01 - chap18
    		Programs from _The_SR_Programming_Language_
		by Andrews and Olsson.
    
    misc	Miscellaneous programs, mostly small ones.

    graphics	Programs using the MPDWin interface to X Windows.

    animator	Programs that use MPDAnimator, the XTANGO interface.

Some of these subdirectories have additional README files.

Because this collection is part of the MPD verification suite, some minor
editing has been done to aid automated testing.  This involved changes
such as:

    Embedding fragments in complete programs
    Reducing output precision to hide floating-point hardware differences
    Removing irreproducible outputs such as age() values
    Removing program nondeterminism

Additionally, the verification process uses some extra files in every
directory (commonly named "Script" and "*.std").  These files may be ignored.
