#  The original SR program found an apparent bug in the Sun C
#  preprocessor; works fine on Vax.  We've isolated the bug as shown
#  below.  It is very sensitive to the location of newlines, but this is
#  like the code that mpd generates.

resource main()
    op str() returns string[10] str
    proc str() returns str { str = "" }
    write("'"||str())
end
