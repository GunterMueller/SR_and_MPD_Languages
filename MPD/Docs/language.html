<H1> The MPD Programming Language -- Overview </H1>

<P> MPD is a variant of the SR programming language.
SR has a Pascal-like syntax and uses guarded commands for
control statements.
MPD has a C-like syntax and C-like control statements.
However, the main components of the two languages are the same:
resources, globals, operations, procs, procedures, processes,
and virtual machines.
Moreover, MPD supports the same variety of concurrent programming
mechanisms as SR:  co statements, semaphores, call/send/forward
invocations, and receive and input statements.

<P> Section 1.9 of the MPD book -- <cite>Foundations of Multithreaded,
Parallel, and Distributed Programming</cite> -- gives a synopsis of MPD.
Follow the links below for additional information.

<ul>

<li> <A HREF="programs/tutorial.html"> Tutorial and Sample Programs.</A>
A tutorial on MPD, illustrated by several programs.

<p> <li> <A HREF="synopsis.html"> Synopsis.</A>
A summary of the components of MPD and their syntax.

<p> <li> <A HREF="howto.html"> Compilation and Execution.</A>
How to compile, link, and execute MPD programs
on single processors, multiprocessors, and clusters.

<p> <li> <A HREF="SRbook.appendixC.ps"> Operators and Predefined Functions.</A>
This Postscript file contains a copy of Appendix C of the SR book.
MPD supports the same kinds of operators and the same predefined functions
as does SR; the <i>only</i> difference is
that the assignment operator in MPD is "<tt>=</tt>" rather than
"<tt>:=</tt>".
<A HREF="SRbook.appendixC.pdf"> PDF</A>
and <A HREF="SRbook.appendixC.html">HTML</a> versions of Appendix C
of the SR book are also available.
The fonts in the PDF version are kind of hard to read, but they print fine.
The HTML version was produced automatically and is kind of
ugly, but it is still useful.

</ul>

<P> The <a href="download/">MPD distribution</a>
contains numerous additional programs as well as
manual pages for the MPD commands.
The book <CITE>The SR Programming Language:  Concurrency in
Practice</CITE> contains detailed descriptions of the semantics
of SR mechanisms, all of which have duals in MPD.
In fact, the MPD distribution contains MPD versions of all the
larger programs in the SR book (see <TT>examples/srbook</TT> in
the distribution).
