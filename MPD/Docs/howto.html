<H1> How to Compile and Execute MPD Programs </H1>

<P> This page summarizes how MPD programs are compiled and executed.
See the manual pages for the mentioned commands for more information.
As a quick reference, the main steps are:

<ol>
<li> Create program in files ending with <tt>.mpd</tt> suffix,
such as <tt>foo.mpd</tt>.

<p> <li> Compile program using <tt>mpd</tt> compiler, as in
<tt>mpd foo.mpd</tt>.

<p> <li> Set MPD_PARALLEL environment variable if running on a shared-memory
multiprocessor.

<p> <li> Execute program with command-line arguments.  The default name
for the executable is <tt>a.out</tt>.

</ol>

<h3> Compilation and Linking </h3>

<p> An MPD program is contained in one or more source files.
Each source file can contain any number of components (resources
or globals).
However, the spec of a component has to be compiled before its body
and before the component is imported by another component.
If two components import each other, their specs can be compiled
in either order but they must be compiled before either body.

<p> The <tt>mpd</tt> compiler makes two passes over the source files
given as arguments to the <tt>mpd</tt> commmand.
First it processes the information in the spec parts of resources
and globals.
Assuming no errors are encountered, the compiler then processes
component bodies, translates the MPD code into a C program, and
calls the C compiler to create separate <tt>.o</tt> files for
each global and resource in the program.

<p> An MPD program is linked by means of the MPD linker <tt>mpdl</tt>.
The linker is called by default by the MPD compiler, and it can be
called explicitly.
The linker combines <tt>.o</tt> files together with the MPD and C
run-time libraries to produced an executable program.
The last resource on the command line to <tt>mpdl</tt> is taken
to be the main resource of the program.
The MPD run-time system has many default values that can be changed by
the programmer.
Execute <tt>mpdl -l</tt> to see the run-time values and their defaults.

<p> During compilation, the MPD compiler creates a directory
<tt>MPDinter</tt> (unless one already exists).
The compiler uses this directory to store files that describe
the resources and globals in a program.
The MPD linker uses the interfaces directory to store <tt>.o</tt> files.

<h3> Single Processor Programs </h3>

<p> If an MPD program does not create virtual machines, then it
contains a single virtual machine and hence a single address space.
(On a Unix system, a virtual machine corresponds to a Unix process.)
Each process in an MPD program is implemented as a thread, with its
own stack and execution state.

<p> An MPD program executes on a single processor if
(1) the host machine contains only a single processor,
(2) MPD is configured for a uniprocessor, or
(3) the <tt>MPD_PARALLEL</tt> environment variable is unset or is
set to a value of 1.
In all of these cases, the processes in the MPD program are
executed one at a time.
In particular, once a process starts executing it continues to
execute until either (1) it calls the MPD run-time system
(e.g., uses synchronization or does I/O),
or (2) it executes a loop more than the maximum number
of loops before a forced context switch.
(See the default values for run-time limits.)

<h3> Multiprocessor Programs </h3>

<p> The multiprocessor implementation of MPD is called MultiMPD.
If MultiMPD has been configured, the MPD programmer asks for
some number <tt>N</tt> of processors by setting the <tt>MPD_PARALLEL</tt>
environment variable to <tt>N</tt>.
For example, with the C shell <tt>csh</tt>, this variable could
be set as follows:

<pre>
    setenv MPD_PARALLEL 4
</pre>

<p> The next time an MPD program is executed, MultiMPD will request
the use of four processors from the underlying system.
Thus, up to four processes in the MPD program could execute
at the same time.
Stated differently, the processes in the MPD program will take
turns executing on up to four physical processors.

<p> The processes in a multiprocessor program can share variables
and should be able to share the same open files.
There are, however, a few subtle synchronization problems in the
implementation.
(See the <a href="release.html">release notes</a> for details.)
In addition, some programming errors may be exposed by MultiMPD that
do not appear when a program is executed on a single processor.

<h3> Distributed Programs </h3>

<p> An MPD program is treated as a distributed program if it
makes explicit use of virtual machines.
In this case, the MPD implementation creates an execution manager,
<tt>mpdx</tt>.
The execution manager is started automatically the first time
an MPD program creates an instance of the <tt>vm</tt> resource
or calls the predefined <tt>locate</tt> function.
The <tt>mpdx</tt> process creates sockets so that virtual machines
can talk to each other (the MPD programmer does not have to worry
about this) and it detects when a distributed MPD program has terminated.

<p> The MPD programmer creates a new virtual machine on physical
machine <tt>X</tt> by executing

<pre>
    create vm() on X
</pre>

The simplest way to specify the value of <tt>X</tt> is to use a string
for the symbolic name of a machine, as in

<pre>
    create vm() on "lectura"
</pre>

<p> Machine names can also be specified using integers, and
the MPD programmer can also use the <tt>locate()</tt> function to
establish associations between integers and hostnames.
The symbolic and integer names of machines are, of course,
installation dependent.
See the MPD <a href="install.html">installation instructions</a>
and <a href="release.html">release notes</a> for information
on configuring and using virtual machines.

<h3> Additional Tools </h3>

<p> Most programmers will only need to use the MPD compiler <tt>mpd</tt>
and linker <tt>mpdl</tt>.
However, there are three additional tools that might be useful:

<ul>
<li> <tt>mpdm</tt>, an MPD program makefile generator

<p> <li> <tt>mpdtrace</tt>, a mechanism for tracing run-time events

<p> <li> <tt>mpdprof</tt>, a trace file profiler
</ul>
